Using the State Pattern, create a puppy simulator program that has two basic functions:
feed or play with the puppy. The puppy will react differently to these functions based on
which state it is in. The puppy has three possible states: asleep, eating, or playing.

Using the following class diagram:

The Puppy class uses instance variables to keep track of the number of times it has been
fed and played with, the states can use the Puppyâ€™s functions to increment, access, and
reset those values when needed.
